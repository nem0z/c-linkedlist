# Basic implementation of linkeslist in C

## How to use this code ?

You can use the bash script `run.sh`:

```sh
    $ ./run.sh
```

It will build and run the `main.c` and provide some example of what you can do using this lib !
/!\ This is only working if `Leaks` is available on your machine as this is now tracking the memory leaks /!\
## Test for each functions are comming soon
